There are always possible improvements. I want to discuss some of them here.
First, the delay measurements were always taken without any CPU load. It would be interesting if the PREEMPT\_RT patch performs better with higher load or just isnâ€™t an application for "Public Devices".

Another improvement would be to always use a GPS module with the server. This would remove frequency fluctuations and provide a better ground truth.

Besides the mentioned time synchronization methods there would also be the option to use the PPS signal on multiple devices. But since NTP has such a slow convergence, PTP would be the better solution.

Further, all measurements were taken with the same kernel version. It could be that a newer kernel or PREEMPT\_RT patch performs differently. Therefore I suggest to repeat the measurements to find the best solution for a specific version.
