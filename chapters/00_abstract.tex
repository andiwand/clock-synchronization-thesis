For a distributed measurement system, like the “Public Devices” project, synchronization of time between the independent measurement units is an indispensable requirement. Since there are already different technologies to achieve that, this thesis is focused on providing a basis for choosing the most appropriate technology. Besides that, it contains suggestions for optimizations about the system and input delay to keep the measurement latency as low as possible.
